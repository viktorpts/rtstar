# rtstar

Framework for a galactic simulation. Includes all orbital parameters as well as a few celestial body properties. A rudimentary pseudorandom generator will create and display a spiral galaxy with 4 arms, using hardcoded parameters. Since each star is generated sperately, the number is limited to a few thousand, to reduce system load. The angle at which the galaxy is rendered on screen can be changed from within the code.
